      <h2>Dynamic Functionality of the Website</h2>
      <p>
        I will have to use JavaScript for three of my pages. It will be needed to for the data fields and the buttons to make sure they 
        work as intended and do what I want them to do. I will use it in the Get Involved page so after the user inputs their information 
        and clicks submit a pop up will show saying thank you for volunterring and will remove the sign up button from the screen since the 
        user is already signed up. I will also use JavaScript in the Contact Us page to make sure the user cant send message if the data fields 
        are blank and after submitting the message it will clear the data fields to allow the user to send another message if they want. 
        Lastly I use JavaScript in the donate page where if the user click one of the predetermined amounts it will appear in the data field 
        below, I will also use it in the donate button where after its clicked it will display a message saying thank you for donating. 
        All of this is being done to help my client succeed in his mission and to allow people to help their community.
